<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Akalya Somasundaram. I am a B TECH-Biotechnology graduate. I have completed my degree in KIT-Kalaignarkarunanidhi Institute of Technology at the year of 2024. Eventhough I have a degree based on life science, I'm pretty much interested in knowing about other sectors, so I learned WEB DEVELOPMENT. I did several projects side by side while gaining knowledge about web development. I'm more excited to get a job where I can implement my skills, and know more through my experience.
